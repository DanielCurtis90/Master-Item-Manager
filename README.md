# GINQO MasterItemManagerâ„¢


# Getting Started
1. Download this extension on a zip file using the 'Clone or Download' button
2. Using the QMC import the zip file as an extension
3. You can now drag and drop the extension into your Qlik Sense application

# Prerequisites
Qlik Sense >= 3.0

# Usage
1. From the Load Editor, create a Data Connection to the template excel file (provided in zip)
2. In your Qlik Sense Application, create one table for the template Dimensions and another for template Measures
3. You can now use the Actions on the Master Items.

# Actions
1. Actions (Eg: Create, Update, Delete) will only affect Master Items that are shown in the Dimensions and Measures tables.
2. Selecting values from the tables will allow actions to be performed only on those selected.
3. Manually defined metrics (though Qlik Sense interface) WILL NOT be affected by this tool's Create, Update, Delete actions 

# Extra Actions
4. Partial Reload: If you are managing a very large Sense App and the excel template scheme has changed, you can use the partial reload option to update the schema without waiting for a full reload to finish.
5. Delete All: This will delete all Dimensions/Measures, including ones defined through Qlik Sense's Interface.
6. Export Measures/Dimensions: This will export Master Items based on the template file scheme, making it easy to copy over manually created Master Items from applications.
